                    <p><h3>BIO</h3>Who lives in a pinnaple under the SEA?! Nobody. People can't do that because the pressure would crush them. Although I can !! I'm here to tell you on my FABULOSE BIO PAGE about myself, and if were lucky I'll tell YOU how my house dosn't just float away, and more if you wanna get to know me. I like to think I'm an open BOOK!</p>
